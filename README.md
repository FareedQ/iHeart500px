# iHeart500px
As a gift to 500px and a self imposed coding challenge, I created an app similar to my InstagramClone with the the 500px API. It displays images and the images can be double clicked to be liked. This app uses OAuth complete both push and pull request.

This app is the first time I connect to an OAuth API. I used the OAuthSwift CocoaPod framework manage the OAuth connection and added the 500px api to their demo file. Please forgive me code, I had some challenges with performing synchronous and asynchronous network call, this is my first time performing OAuth.

All code for execution can be found at in the https://github.com/FareedQ/iHeart500px/blob/master/iHeart500px/MainVC.swift
